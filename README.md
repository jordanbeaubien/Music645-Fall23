# Music645-Fall23

In this course, students will learn various approaches to creating interactive digital audio artworks, concentrating on the digital platform of the computer and/or web browser. The course will expose students to creative coding techniques for sound, as well as integrating audio into mixed digital media environments, with the goal of each student creating an original artwork. We will spend significant time discussing artistic practice and works by other digital audio artists throughout the course.
